Git problem solved 
Step-by-step fix:
Open your RStudio terminal.
Run this command to see your current PATH:
echo $PATH
You’ll probably see Conda paths at the front, and /usr/bin may be missing.
To temporarily fix the PATH inside RStudio terminal right now, run:
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
Now try:
git --version
It should show Git version (instead of “command not found”).
You can now run:
git init
