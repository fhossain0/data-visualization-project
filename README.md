Git problem solved 
Step-by-step fix:

To see your current PATH:
echo $PATH

To temporarily fix the PATH inside RStudio terminal right now, run:
export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
Now try:
git --version
It should show Git version (instead of “command not found”).
You can now run:
git init

rebase git
- git pull --rebase origin main
- git push --set-upstream origin main
